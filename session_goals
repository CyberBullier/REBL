1.) stop adding product once stock thrshold reach
2.) show how many products in shopping count
3.) remove quantitity when press minus icon while in cart
4.) remove product when trash icon pressed


need to eventually implement:
1. appropriate logic for different products
2. even if cart is empty , icon should still appear and you should be able to
click it, thus getting redirected to empty cart
